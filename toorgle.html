<h1>Toorgle</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>There are so many different torrent search engines out there to choose from nowadays, finding the best one can be a stressful and time-consuming task. Almost as stressful and time consuming as finding an elusive torrent can be if you are using a subpar torrent search engine. Which is why it is always worth it to find the best torrent search engine you can ahead of time. You will end up saving yourself a lot of grief in the long run. <br><br>

Lucky for you, though, thanks to TorrentSites, the process of finding a great torrent search engine has become much easier. Gone are the days of scouring every corner of the internet until you find a site that has every torrent file you could ever hope for. Gone are the days of trial and error, of having to personally go through every torrent site you hear about in hopes of finding a dependable one that is well-designed and brimming with high-quality, safe torrents. All you have to do is scroll through one of my many lists of torrent search engines and, in no time, figure out which one is perfect for you.<br><br>

Even though the only sites that I review and include in my lists are the best of the best, that does not necessarily mean that every single one will be the best for you. There are several different kinds of torrent search engines here for you to choose from. Some torrent sites have large communities of fellow users, others are very genre specific and tend to be rather exclusive. The right one for you is going to depend on what you are looking to get out of your site of choice.<br><br>

The more casual P2P file sharers among us might prefer the larger, more popular torrent sites. These sites are great for helping you dependably and easily locating any number of free indie movies, free indie TV shows, free indie music, open-source software, free indie eBooks, etc. However, if you are looking for a more obscure file, something that you have been unable to find elsewhere on the web, you might have better luck with one of the many smaller, more niche specific torrent sites. These can be difficult to access, though, due to many of them being invite only. The extra investigation that goes into getting a registration link might just be worth it, still, if you are looking for a tight knit community of likeminded torrent experts.<br><br>

There are even more subsets of torrent sites out there, too. Some, for instance, host torrent files directly. These are the most common types of torrent search engines. Another type of torrent site, however, also exists. These are known as meta search engines. Alternately, you might see them referred to as torrent site aggregators. They are called this because, instead of providing magnet links and download links to torrents directly, they combine search results to numerous (sometimes hundreds) of other torrent sites, making it easier than ever to browse nearly every torrent in existence of a given file.<br><br>

Torrent site aggregators, like any other category of torrent site, have their inherent strengths and weaknesses. On the one hand, the fact that you have access to a multitude of different torrent sites all from one convenient location is awesome. On the other hand, though, there is no telling if every site that a torrent meta search engine turns up is credible, reputable, or reliable in any way. So, before downloading a torrent from one of the sites that your torrent aggregator turns up, I still request checking back in to TorrentSites to get a glimpse into the third-party site in question. Still, though, there are a few things to keep in mind for smart torrenting.<br><br>

First, if a site has a torrent verification system, that is a good sign. It means that people have gone through and checked torrents to ensure that A.) the files contain what they claim to, and B.) the torrent downloads are free of any viruses or trojans, etc. If a torrent search engine does not have a system of torrent verification, you can always check for a comments section. This is another sign of a trustworthy torrent site. Especially if that comments section is active. If there is a problem with a torrent, the discussion here will address it, giving you a proper heads-up.<br><br>

With those preliminary precautions laid out, now we can take a look at one of the most effective torrent meta search engines on the web: Toorgle. Offering a fun twist on everyone’s favorite search engine, Google, that is not all that Toorgle has to offer. This torrent search engine draws from over 450 individual torrent sites. So, when you search for a free indie title, you have page after page of files to choose from. This is a great site for anyone who is new to torrenting because, well, it is basically Google but only for Torrent sites.<br><br>

With that in mind, let us take a dive in and see where Toorgle stands in the spectrum of the best torrent sites. Does it have what it takes to be the only torrent search engine you will ever need? Well, let’s find out!

		<h1>Design</h1>

As is expected given the name, Toorgle looks a lot like Google. You will be greeted by the familiar search engine layout – lots of white space with nothing but a search bar and a bright logo. In the case of Toorgle, the logo appears in a stark blue against the white backdrop, reminiscent of Google’s iconic bright rainbow theme. <br><br>

That is really all there is to it. Once you conduct your search, just browse through the search results. You can also choose how your search results are arranged. Select either by relevance or date. There is no “Feeling Lucky” option. But, hey, who really uses that anyway, right?</p>

		<h1>Content and Features</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>Your search results, which Toorgle heavily advertises as being “enhanced by Google,” it turns out, will include things other than just torrent sites. Searching for free indie music, for instance, yields lyrics and music videos alongside torrent sites on which you can download the free indie songs and free indie albums you love. Personally, I am torn when it comes to how I feel about this. On the one hand, I appreciate it when torrent sites provide supplementary media and information alongside torrents. On the other, these are the results that often appear first, leaving you to have to dig for the torrents that you came for. <br><br>

Toorgle also offers an extension for your Mozilla Firefox browser (a handy quick search add-on), as well as a Facebook extension. This makes it easier than ever to search for torrents on a whim without having to disrupt your usual web browsing routine. This is a very cool feature, one that I would love to see more torrent search engines consider offering.
