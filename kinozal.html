<h1>Kinozal</h1>

		<p>Are you looking to download all of the best free indie TV shows, free indie movies, free indie documentaries, free indie music, open-source software, free indie video games, and free indie eBooks? Well, if so, you have come to the right place. Torrent Sites is here to help you find the most dependable and effective torrent search engines that the internet has to offer – all in one convenient and easy to navigate place! No matter what kind of free indie content you are looking to download, Torrent Sites and the best torrent search engines will make it possible. The key word there, though, it “best.” There are new torrent search engines going up all the time, and not all of them, it turns out, are going to be worth your time and energy. <br><br>

Certain torrent search engines, for example, may have a lack of files. Perhaps you are looking for episodes of a popular free indie TV series … you need to find a torrent site that at least can guarantee that you will be able to find it. Believe it or not, even the most popular free indie shows sometimes cannot be found on some torrent sites. Therefore, this is the very first thing that I look for when I am testing out a torrent search site. These sites, after all, are only as good as the free indie content they allow you to download. In some ways, this results in a numbers game. The more files, the better. <br><br>

It’s not all about quantity, though. Equally important to the number of torrents that a site offers is the quality of those torrents. A torrent search engine, in other words, could have torrents of every file you could ever imagine, but it won’t be worth much if those files are not able to be downloaded, and downloaded quickly. For this, you are also going to want to look at the seeder to leecher ratio on a site’s torrents. A low number of seeders (people uploading and sharing the file) can result in slow downloads. Or, worse yet, the file may not be able to download at all. Peer 2 Peer file sharing, naturally, relies heavily on the activity of the peers in question.<br><br>

Therefore, the best torrent search engines will not only have favorable seeder to leecher ratios, but they will also clearly indicate these numbers alongside the rest of the torrent’s information. You should not have to put in too much work, in other words, to discover whether a torrent has a favorable ratio. This information should be displayed right in the search results. If you have to click into the torrent’s info page to find this out, you are already wasting too much time.<br><br>

Next, when it comes time to choose a go-to torrent site, you have to look at the safety measures in place on a given site. This can be achieved in a few different ways, but the most common include comments sections and a system of torrent verification. Some sites opt to let their users police files themselves, letting them discuss it in the comments section. If a file is suspect or potentially malicious, users should make that known in the comments.<br><br>

Verified torrents, too, help give you a sense of security when downloading. Verified torrents let you know that the site itself has looked into the file and has verified that A.) it includes what it claims to, and B.) none of the files are corrupted or contain viruses. Ideally, though, your torrent search engine will provide both verified torrents and a comments section. The more safety measures the better.<br><br>

Either way, though, even if a torrent search engine provides you with security measures such as these, I still advise everyone looking to get into torrenting to find themselves a quality antivirus software. Some torrent clients, actually, even come with antivirus programs built in. This is always helpful. Additionally, a Virtual Private Network (VPN) is recommended in order to protect your privacy.<br><br>

And it is, more or less, easy sailing from there. The only other major concerns are site design – you want a user-friendly interface, easy browsing, and advanced search capabilities – and convenience (is the site in question mobile friendly? Does it offer an app for even more mobile-friendly torrent downloading?). These are some of the questions that you need to ask yourself before relying on a new torrent search engine.<br><br>

All of this said, how does the Russian torrent search engine, Kinozal TV stack up against the competition? And, believe me, the competition is pretty stiff. Let’s dive in and see just how Kinozal works, and if it is worth your time and energy.

		<h1>Design</h1>
		<hr>

Frankly, from an aesthetic perspective, I am not a huge fan of Kinozal. I think that it looks rather cheesy, if I am being honest. The theme is confusing and does not make the eye want to linger, in a fast-food combination of yellows and reds. And the whole site is framed with an open curtain, again adding to a somewhat corny look and feel. <br><br>

However, for what it’s worth, if you are able to overlook these more superficial concerns, Kinozal is pretty user-friendly. A bit cluttered, sure, but the site makes it clear enough how to browse and search for files. And most of the files have a thumbnail image and lots of info associated with them, so, that always helps. <br><br>

Kinozal is clearly geared towards free indie film and TV, and the site’s design reflects that. A quick look at the site menu bar at the top of the page will make that clear. Choose from Forum, Registration, Hands [users], Top Hands [top users], Persons, New Films, and Groups to browse the site.<br><br>

Additionally, there are a great deal of ads on this site which, I think, add to the unprofessional look and the cluttered nature. The impede in on the content from the margins, making for a bit of a chaotic user experience.

		<p>As I just hinted at, Kinozal is pretty good at letting its users browse free indie movies and TV shows. Perhaps, as this is a torrent search engine meant to cater to all file types, the site could also be reorganized so that browsing other file types would be just as simple. But the fact that you can browse by top users, actors, and new releases makes this a great site for finding great movies – Russian or international. <br> <br>

The forum, too, is a nice touch. Here, you can link up with other torrent file sharers to discuss your favorite free indie films, torrenting in general, and anything else that comes to mind. Added to the fact that Kinozal also has a comments section on each file makes for a very community-oriented torrent search engine, which is something you definitely want in a site like this. This is why it strikes me as odd that Kinozal does not appear to have many seeders. At least not for international content. If you are looking to download the latest in Russian free indie media primarily, though, this will be a good site for you.
