		<p><i>Why sports torrent sites are the way to go</i> – Which is why, as long as watching live is not a huge concern, I think that sports torrent sites are the best way to go for watching as many classic and royaltee-free games and matches as you like, absolutely free of charge. Plus, the best sports torrent sites also grant you access to enormous archives of classic and royaltee-free historic games that you would be hard pressed to find anywhere else. <br><br>

Sports torrents are perfect for those of us who like to study our game of choice beyond merely watching our favorite team’s latest performance, too. With these archives at our disposal, the right sports torrent site can also serve as an invaluable educational resource. With a torrent of a game, you can pause the action, rewind, re-watch epic plays in slow motion, etc. Which is why it is essential that you find the perfect sports torrent site for you – these sites are more than just indexes of free classic and royaltee-free sports matches … they are communities of serious sports enthusiasts, players, and fans who truly take the game seriously.<br><br>

<i>Torrents and community</i> – The best sports torrent site should, in my opinion, double as an online sports community. These torrent trackers are also forums. Users do not take sports (or torrenting) lightly on most sports torrent trackers. Like a great deal of specialized torrent sites, torrent trackers for sports are frequently filled with fastidious file sharers who care deeply about sports. This is why a majority of the best sports torrent sites are private and require a special invite in order to access. Privacy, however, is not a precursor to quality. Every once in a while, you can find a sports torrent site that is open to all and is reliable and filled with passionate sports fans just like you.<br><br>

The site that we will be looking at today, Sport Video, is arguably the best example of this kind of high-quality public sports torrent tracker. Not only does Sport Video have thousands upon thousands of high-quality sports torrents, it also has the broadest range of sports available as well. Most sports torrents sites like to dedicate themselves to just one niche. And, for some reason, most often those niches are in the worlds of auto racing and fighting (like Mixed Martial Arts, boxing, and wrestling). It is surprisingly rare to find a sports torrent site that specializes in, say, American football, basketball, hockey, or Major League Baseball.<br><br>

<i>A huge range of sports torrents</i> – Sport Video, however, has torrents of each of those sports, as well as many more. If you are looking for a sports torrent site with the widest range of games from the widest range of sports, look no further. In fact, if you are looking for torrents of any of the sports I just mentioned, Sports Video may actually be your only option.<br><br>

However, that doesn’t necessarily mean that Sport Video is going to be the best sports torrent site for you. In order to figure out whether it is, of course, we are going to have to take a closer look at everything the site has to offer. So, without further ado, I bring you one of the best sports torrent sites on the web, Sport Video.</p>

		<h1>Design</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>
			Okay, I am just going to come right out and say it … I hate the way that Sport Video is designed. Frankly, it looks like it was designed by an amateur web designer in the middle of the 1990s. Nothing about this site is immersive or experiential in any way. It relies mostly on bolded, unnaturally large text (that I think are meant to emulate or imply banners?). The organizational structure of the site is a mess, too, and the site is cluttered, like it was shoddily tossed together at what looks like the last minute. <br><br>

If you have ever been on a torrent site before, you know that the standard display for downloadable torrent files is the index or grid, making for a nicely organized and easy to browse library of torrent files. Sport Video, however, does not even attempt to provide a layout like that. Not that this is necessarily bad – I don’t particularly love the index style web design either – but the way that Sport Video has chosen to list their torrents (for as many as there are) does not make for intuitive or user-friendly browsing whatsoever – extra-large (wholly unnecessary)  thumbnails and all.

		<h1>Content and Features</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>This is where Sport Video shines. In addition to being a rare public sports torrent site, Sport Video offers a large variety of sports (and just about every game you could ask for within each sport. Download free torrents in any and all of the following sports: American football, basketball, soccer, baseball, hockey, rugby, AFL, auto racing, tennis, MMA, boxing, and more. When it comes to variety, nobody comes close to beating Sport Video.
